# mcet-drl-control
This is the repo for the Major Project I worked on in my undergrad final year. It is titled "Intelligent Spacecraft Attitude Control using Deep Reinforcement Learning."

This project directly utilized the work previously done by Jacob Elkins [original work](https://github.com/jakeelkins/rl-attitude-control) as a base to reconfigure the TD3 controller developed to be trainable in a RL toolbox based simulation environment in MATLAB.
