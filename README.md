# mcet-drl-control
MCET Major Project on "Intelligent Spacecraft Attitude Control using Deep Reinforcement Learning"

This repo consists of all the files I worked with while working on this project.

This project directly used the work previously done by Jacob Elkins [orignial work](https://github.com/jakeelkins/rl-attitude-control) as a base to reconfigure the TD3 controller developed to be trainable in a RL toolbox based simulation environment in MATLAB.
