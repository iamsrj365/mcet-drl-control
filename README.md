# mcet-drl-control
This is the repo for my undergrad final year project titled "Intelligent Spacecraft Attitude Control using Deep Reinforcement Learning."

This project directly utilized the work previously done by Jacob Elkins [original work](https://github.com/jakeelkins/rl-attitude-control) as a base to reconfigure the TD3 controller developed to be trainable in a RL toolbox based simulation environment in MATLAB. A comparison between their performances in OpenAI Gym and RL-toolbox based environments was made.
